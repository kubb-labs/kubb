# Changelog

## v5.0.1 — Aug 19, 2026

### @kubb/kit

#### Bug Fixes

- Fix `Url.toPath` producing an invalid Express-style route for a hyphenated path parameter (e.g. `{point-id}` became `:point-id`). `path-to-regexp` treats a hyphen as ending the parameter name, so the generated MSW handler matched `:point` followed by a literal `-id` and rejected valid values. `Url.toPath` now camelCases the parameter name the same way `Url.toTemplateString` already does, so `{point-id}` becomes `:pointId`. ([#3895](https://github.com/kubb-labs/kubb/pull/3895), [`bf9bdc8`](https://github.com/kubb-labs/kubb/commit/bf9bdc823a2fe06225d2a01b93caa618372e6c6b))

## v5.0.0

Kubb v5 rebuilds code generation around adapters, a universal AST, parsers, and storage, and generates code up to 5.4x faster than v4. Config gets shorter, generated client calls change shape, and plugins move to their own repo ([kubb-labs/plugins](https://github.com/kubb-labs/plugins)).

Read the [release blog post](https://kubb.dev/blog/v5) for the highlights, and the [migration guide](https://kubb.dev/docs/5.x/migration) for the full, per-package breaking-change list and upgrade steps.

For prior releases, see [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kubb-labs/kubb/releases).
