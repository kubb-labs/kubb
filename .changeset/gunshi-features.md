'@kubb/cli': patch
---

Adds `--dryRun` to `generate` and `init` to preview a run without writing files, installing packages, formatting, linting, or running post-generate commands. When an AI coding agent runs the CLI, `generate` now uses the plain logger instead of the interactive one, and anonymous telemetry records the agent's name.
