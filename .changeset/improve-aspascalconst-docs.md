Improve JSDoc documentation for `asPascalConst` enumType option

Enhanced the JSDoc comments for the `enumType` option to clearly document all available enum type options, including `asPascalConst`. This makes it clear that `asPascalConst` is a fully supported option that generates enum-like constants with PascalCase names (e.g., `const PetType`) as an alternative to `asConst` which uses camelCase names (e.g., `const petType`).
