'@kubb/studio': patch
'@kubb/core': patch

Keep recent generations by job id and snapshot the output directory before each run, so Studio can diff a run against an earlier one or against the files on disk. Agents with a project keep them in `node_modules/.cache/kubb`, so they survive a restart, and sandboxes keep them in memory. Breaking for the Studio connection: `readFiles` now takes a `jobId` and a `source`, and `GenerateResult.changes` is replaced by `hashes` and `disk.hashes`. `@kubb/core` now exports `cacheStorage`.
