`kubb generate --watch` now works with URL inputs. A remote document emits no filesystem events, so watch mode polls the URL (every 2 seconds) and regenerates when the response body changes. Each poll request times out after 10 seconds, so a hung server never stalls the watcher. An unreachable server is reported once per outage and polling continues. After recovery, a rebuild only happens when the document actually changed, unless the server was already down at startup, in which case the first successful poll regenerates so the output catches up. Previously `--watch` was silently ignored for URL inputs and the CLI exited after a single build.
