# About Kubb

## Introduction

`Kubb`'s name is based on the popular Swedisch game [Kubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubb).

<blockquote>
 Kubb (pronounced [kubÀê] in Swedish and Gutnish) is a lawn game where the objective is to knock over wooden blocks (kubbar) by throwing wooden batons (kastpinnar) at them. Kubb can be described as a combination of bowling and horseshoes.
</blockquote>
This is one of my favorite games to play in the summer, so when I was searching for an easy and short name I took `Kubb`.

When reading the name you would think `Kubb` means cube which also refers to that every feature is its plugin or with other words: **a cube per feature**.

<hr/>

At this moment `Kubb` is a library to create clients based on a Swagger file but `Kubb` was designed to also work with something else than Swagger.
Because everything is a plugin, it will also make it really easy for other developers to create their plugin that implements for example a generation for GraphQL.
See [Create your plugin](/plugins/template) for more information about how to create your plugin.
