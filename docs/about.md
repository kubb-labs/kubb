# About Kubb

## What Does "Kubb" Mean?

**Kubb is named after the popular Swedish lawn game [Kubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubb).** The name reflects the project's philosophy: just as the game Kubb uses wooden blocks (kubbar), our Kubb uses modular plugins as building blocks.

<blockquote>
 Kubb (pronounced [kubː] in Swedish and Gutnish) is a lawn game where the objective is to knock over wooden blocks (kubbar) by throwing wooden batons (kastpinnar) at them. Kubb can be described as a combination of bowling and horseshoes.
</blockquote>

**Why this name?**
- Short, memorable, and easy to type
- Reflects the modular, plugin-based architecture
- "Kubb" sounds like "cube" - each feature is its own plugin cube
- It's the creator's favorite summer game

## Project Philosophy

**A cube per feature.** Every feature in Kubb is implemented as a separate plugin. This design enables:
- Choose only the plugins you need
- Community-driven plugin ecosystem
- Easy to extend with custom functionality
- Clear separation of concerns

### Current Focus: OpenAPI Code Generation

Kubb currently specializes in generating TypeScript code from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. The plugin architecture makes it possible to extend Kubb to support other specification formats in the future.

**Why plugin-based?**
- Developers can create custom plugins for their specific needs
- Mix and match official and community plugins
- Update individual plugins without affecting the core
