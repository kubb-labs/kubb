# Filter and sort OpenAPI files

> [!TIP]
> Previous Kubb versions used `openapi-format` internally, but v3 removed this.

Use [openapi-format](https://github.com/thim81/openapi-format) to filter operations and paths. The tool orders fields, formats casing (PascalCase, camelcase) of component elements, and more.
