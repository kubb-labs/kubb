# Introduction

Hi üëãüèΩ and welcome to Kubb<img width="30" style="display: inline-block;line-height: 30px;" src="/logo.png"/>!<br/>
My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/stijnvanhulle">Stijn Van Hulle</a>, the creator of Kubb and I'm super excited to have you here! Let me give you a quick introduction to Kubb and what it can do for you.

<b>Kubb</b> is a library and toolkit that converts your Swagger/OpenAPI specification to one of the generated client libraries(TypeScript, React-Query, Zod, Zodios, Faker.js and Axios).

<hr/>

Imagine that your backend team is writing an API in Java/Kotlin, how do you connect your frontend to their system without the need of communicating on every API change.
This is not a new problem and has already been resolved with the use of a Swagger/OpenAPI specification and a <a href="https://tools.openapis.org/categories/code-generators.html">code generator</a>.

The problem is that most of them are good at one _thing_: generating TypeScript types or generating React-Query hooks. Kubb is trying to resolve that with a plugin system where we already provide you with some <a href="/plugins/introduction">generation plugins</a> but also giving you the possibilty to create your own generation plugin without the need of forking the full project.

## Motivation

Swagger/OpenAPI has been used a lot as a contract between frontend and backend teams, this was the same for the last couple of projects I did. Every project is different so it always came down in choosing one of the provided <a href="https://tools.openapis.org/categories/code-generators.html">code generators</a> or the default one of <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/">Swagger</a>. But that wasn't enough for my needs üôÅ.

Main features ‚ú®:

- Every generated client(React-Query, MSW, Zod, ...) is contained in it's own package.
- Clean code that follows the examples of the client(no extra un-needed boilerplate code).
- Out-of-box <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> (with JSDoc) support.
- Open-source first.
- Plugins system based on Rollup, esbuild,
- CLI support.

## Configuration File

Kubb uses [Cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) for the configuration file support.
This means you can configure Kubb via (in order of precedence):

- A "kubb" key in your package.json file.
- A `.kubbrc` file written in JSON or YAML.
- A `.kubbrc.json` file.
- A `.kubbrc.js`, `.kubbrc.cjs`, `kubb.config.js`, or `kubb.config.cjs` file that exports an object using module.exports.
- A `.kubbrc.ts` or `kubb.config.ts` file that exports an object using export default.

::: tip
You can also use `configs/kubb.config.ts` or `.config/kubb.config.ts` instead of `kubb.config.ts` in the root of your project.

See [kubb.config.js](/configuration/options) on how to configure Kubb.
