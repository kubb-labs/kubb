Path to the client that will be used to do the API calls. Supports both relative and absolute paths.

Generated code will import:
- client as default import
- types as named type imports

Example for axios client:
```typescript
/**
 * Generated by Kubb (https://kubb.dev/).
 * Do not edit manually.
 */
import client from '${client.importPath}'
import type { RequestConfig, ResponseErrorConfig } from '${client.importPath}'
// ... rest of generated file
```
