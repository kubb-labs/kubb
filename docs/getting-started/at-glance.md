## Philosophy

Imagine that your backend team is writing an API in Java/Kotlin, how do you connect your frontend to their system without the need of communicating on every API change.
This is not a new problem and has already been resolved with the use of a Swagger/OpenAPI specification combined with a <a href="https://tools.openapis.org/categories/code-generators.html">code generator</a>. This concept is called [contract-first development](https://medium.com/@dxloop/contract-first-approach-with-node-js-and-openapi-for-rest-services-d2283a7ffd9d) and one of our maintainer wrote this amazing article showing casing the use cases of Kubb.

The problem is that most of them are good at one _thing_: generating TypeScript types or generating React-Query hooks.
Kubb is trying to resolve that with a plugin system where we already provide you with some plugins but also giving you the possibility to create [your own plugin](/knowledge-base/plugins/).
