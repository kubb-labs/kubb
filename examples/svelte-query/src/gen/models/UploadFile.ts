* Title: Swagger Petstore - OpenAPI 3.0

* Description: This is a sample Pet Store Server based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.  You can find out more about
* Swagger at [https://swagger.io](https://swagger.io). In the third iteration of the pet store, we've switched to the design first approach!
* You can now help us improve the API whether it's by making changes to the definition itself or to the code.
* That way, with time, we can improve the API in general, and expose some of the new features in OAS3.
* 
* Some useful links:
* - [The Pet Store repository](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore)
* - [The source API definition for the Pet Store](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/blob/master/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml)
