 * Title: Swagger Petstore - OpenAPI 3.0
 * Description: This is a sample Pet Store Server based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.  You can find out more about
 * Swagger at [https://swagger.io](https://swagger.io). In the third iteration of the pet store, we've switched to the design first approach!
 * You can now help us improve the API whether it's by making changes to the definition itself or to the code.
 * That way, with time, we can improve the API in general, and expose some of the new features in OAS3.
 *
